For a class, we were asked to take apart a machine and explain how it worked in terms of our fluid mechanics course. My group's device was an LG washing machine pump. My role in the project was taking the device apart and taking all the relevant measurements of the pump so we could perform our analysis. I also helped my group do our calculations and write the script for a video we filmed explaining our findings. Below is the link to our video!
